# Weather Journal App
This project is intended to build a Weather Journal app adopting an asynchronous web app approach consuming a web API to dynamically update the UI.

I'll be using [OpenWeatherMap]OpenWeatherMap wich is one of the leading digital weather information providers.

The web app will update the UI calling the API and fetching the weather information requested by the end user.
